# JasonData1030Project
Jason Covey Data1030 Project - How accurately can an ML model predict chess results?

In this project, I will use SciKitLearn and other python packages to create an ML model that will attempt to predict the results of chess games from teh 20,000 LiChess game data publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess.

The data folder contains the raw data used for the project, src contains an ipynb file with the code used, results contains the models trained and their test scores which can be accessed using pickle, figures contains graphs and images generated in the project, and report contains the write up and extra details about the project
