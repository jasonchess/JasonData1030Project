Jason Covey Data1030 Project - How accurately can an ML model predict chess results?

In this project, I will use SciKitLearn and other python packages to create an ML model that will attempt to predict the results of chess games from teh 20,000 LiChess game data publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess.
